What was done:

1) cleaned the data (Dropped NaN values from DataFrame, 
removed rows based on a condition, 
changed  the type of columns to_numeric, to_datetime)

2) Tried to explore 5 high level business questions related to my data:
- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?


As a result here are my conclusions:
- Based on this data, the best month for sales was December with sales approximately 4 million and 6 hundreds dollars.
- San Francisco sold the most product in comparing with others according to our data.
- To my mind, the most suitable time is before 11 a.m. or earlier (like 7 a.m.)
- 'iPhone' and 'Lightning Charging Cable' is a pair of the most often sold products together. The rarelier pairs are:
'Google Phone'  + 'USB-C Charging Cable' and 'iPhone', 'Wired Headphones'.
